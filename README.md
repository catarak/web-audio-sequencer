# Baby's First Web Audio Sequencer

This is my first forray into the world of the Web Audio API! I decided to create a drum sequencer, because, who doesn't love playing with drum machines?

* [Virtual Synth Pad Tutorial](http://www.sitepoint.com/html5-web-audio-api-tutorial-building-virtual-synth-pad/) - A great starter tutorial, with a few issues
* [Audio Scheduling](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/) - An important read on why you need to synchronize to the Web Audio API clock
